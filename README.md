# dissertation-TCP-string-distances
This is a tool which can read in, parse and prioritise a test suite using a range of string distances and prioritisation methods.

This is my final year dissertation project. I plan to continue to work on it after my studies. I believe this tool could be a useful framework for developers looking to prioritise their test cases based on string distances of their choosing.

At its current state, it is very much bespoke for Java methods and a test suite generated using Randoop. I hope to make this a drag-and-drop tool for methods of any OO language.
